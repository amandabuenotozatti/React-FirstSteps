## Introduction to React 

> The Objective of this project is to pratice and study React fundamentals.
> A curse offered by Digital Innovation One - DIO and some contents were added by me through research and reading documentation.

#### Knowing and configuring React
- JSX
- Functional Programming
- Syntax
- Styles with CSS

#### Rendering Elements
- Element rendering
- React DOM
- Root Node
- Class Components 
- Function Components

Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

Components come in two types: Class components and Function components.

In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate the behavior you need. So, you might just render some of the elements depending on the state of your application. Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript.

A class component must include the extends React.Component statement. This statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.
